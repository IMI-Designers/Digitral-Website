                a.	Where we are relying on your consent to process your personal data, you can withdraw your consent to our processing your personal data at any time. You can do this by contacting Us at <a href="mailto:info@digitral.com"> info@digitral.com </a>. In certain circumstances, we can process your personal data without your consent in line with the lawful processing requirements.

              </li>
              <li> 
                b.	Ask us to rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal data. We would seek to rectify the data as soon as possible and usually within one month unless the request is complex.  
              </li>
              <li>
                c.	Ask Us to erase your personal data. This is commonly referred to as the right to be forgotten.

In such cases, we would retain the data but we would not process it further without your consent, or if processing your data is for establishing, exercising or defending a legal claim, or for the protection of rights of other individuals, or for public interest reasons. In such circumstances, we would let you know that we intend to lift the restriction on processing your personal data.  
              </li>  
              <li>
                e.	Request access to your personal data via a subject access request. Your request should be made to us in writing by email to <a href="mailto:info@digitral.com"> info@digitral.com </a>  and we may ask you for proof of your identity before providing you with the data.

              <li>
                f.	You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes (including profiling).
